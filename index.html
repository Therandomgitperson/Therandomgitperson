    <h1> Mom, I'm sorry, I'm the person that you live for, but I've betrayed your trust. I've lied to you about something so simple, and something I can do easily that I didn't, I'm sorry, you have every right to give up on me, in fact, you could've given up on me before a long time ago, yet you haven't, you always were there to make me never give up, to get me into the last carriage of the train, you paid for my school fees when you could've bought a house, you were there to stop dad from giving all the money to my brothers. I'm apologizing because I broke your trust, and lied about something that would help in my education, which is truly stupid, for it helps me and is useful, and I'm truly stupid for not doing it. I'm sorry, I wish that our relationship can be fixed, for I'm truly sorry for what I've done after all you've done.</h1>
